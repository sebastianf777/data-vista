# Data Vista üöÄ

Data Vista is a Next.js 13 project built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS that fetches and displays data from multiple public APIs in a flexible, interactive, and responsive UI. It demonstrates advanced features like server‚Äëside data fetching, filtering, sorting, paginated tables, reusable components, and error handling.

## Overview üîç

Data Vista is designed to be a showcase of best practices in modern full‚Äëstack development using Next.js with the App Router. It provides a set of pages that consume public APIs such as:
- **Users API** (from JSONPlaceholder)
- **Posts API** (from JSONPlaceholder)
- **Countries API** (from REST Countries)
- **CoinGecko API** (for cryptocurrency data)

Each page features:
- **Server‚Äëside data fetching** with TypeScript for type safety.
- **Filtering, sorting, and pagination** logic encapsulated in a reusable utility.
- **Dynamic column selection** allowing the user to choose which data columns to display.
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS.
- **Error handling** via error boundaries and a reusable error component.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Modular & Reusable Components**
    - **`paginated-table`**: A generic component that accepts data of any type (`T`), column definitions, and search parameters.
    - **`filter-form`**: A reusable form to filter, sort, and customize table columns.
    - **`only-table`**: A simple table component that dynamically renders content based on column definitions (supports images with Next.js Image).
    - **`navbar`**: A responsive navigation bar component that highlights the active route.
    - **`error-component`**: A reusable error boundary UI.

- **Advanced Data Processing**
    - Server‚Äëside filtering, sorting, and pagination using a shared utility function (`filter-and-paginate.ts`).
    - Data preprocessing to combine nested properties (e.g., native names, capital summaries, etc.) for easy display.

- **Robust Error Handling**
    - Graceful handling of API errors with optional retry logic.
    - Reusable error boundary (`error.tsx`) and global error (`global-error.tsx`).

- **Optimized for Performance**
    - Minimal client-side JavaScript by leveraging server components in Next.js 13.
    - TypeScript ensures compile-time safety and easier refactoring.
